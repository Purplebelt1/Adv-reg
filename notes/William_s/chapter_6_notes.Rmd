Finds the logistic model with 1 way and an alt method
```{R}
model.HaleD <- glm(cbind(YesVotes, NumVotes - YesVotes) ~
    distance, family = binomial, data = rrHale.df)
# alternative expression
model.HaleD.alt <- glm(YesVotes / NumVotes ~ distance, 
    weights = NumVotes, family = binomial, data = rrHale.df)
```


Adds new predictor
```{R}
model.HaleBD <- glm(cbind(YesVotes, NumVotes - YesVotes) ~
  distance + pctBlack, family = binomial, data = rrHale.df)
```


drop dev test to check two models
```{R}
drop_in_dev <- anova(model.HaleD, model.HaleBD, test = "Chisq")
```


Expoentiates the CIs
```{R}
exp(confint(model.HaleBD))
```


GOF test
```{R}
1-pchisq(307.2173, 8) 
```



New log reg with interaction
```{R}
model.HaleBxD <- glm(cbind(YesVotes, NumVotes - YesVotes) ~
  distance + pctBlack + distance:pctBlack, 
  family = binomial, data = rrHale.df)
```


Drop in dev to test two models against eachother
```{R}
drop_in_dev <- anova(model.HaleBD, model.HaleBxD, 
                     test = "Chisq")
````



Makes a quasibinomial with same predictors as last
```{R}
model.HaleBxDq <- glm(cbind(YesVotes, NumVotes - YesVotes) ~
  distance + pctBlack + distance:pctBlack, 
  family = quasibinomial, data = rrHale.df)
```



Makes quasi model with less predictor
```{R}
model.HaleBDq <- glm(cbind(YesVotes, NumVotes - YesVotes) ~
  distance + pctBlack, 
  family = quasibinomial, data = rrHale.df)
```


Makes new bimodial
```{R}
model1 <- glm(lose.wt.01 ~ female, family = binomial, 
              data = risk2009)
```


adds new predictor
```{R}
model2 <- glm(lose.wt.01 ~ female + bmipct, 
              family = binomial, data = risk2009)
```

adds new predictor
```{R}
model3 <- glm(lose.wt.01 ~ female + bmipct + sport, 
              family = binomial, data = risk2009)
```

adds new interaction predictor
```{R}
model3int <- glm(lose.wt.01 ~ female + bmipct + sport +
              female:sport + bmipct:sport, 
              family = binomial, data = risk2009)
```

removes interaction
```{R}
model4 <- glm(lose.wt.01 ~ female + bmipct + media, 
              family = binomial, data = risk2009)
```

Tests a bunch of models against each other
```{R}
drop_in_dev <- anova(model1, model2, model3, model4,
                     test="Chisq")
```
