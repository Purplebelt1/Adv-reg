Calculates the maximum likelihood estimator for the probability of having a boy  given the counts of boys and girls and the number of points in the probability grid.
```{R}
Lik.f <- function(nBoys,nGirls,nGrid){
    # possible values for prob a boy is born
    pb <- seq(0, 1, length = nGrid)   
    lik <- pb^{nBoys} * (1 - pb)^{nGirls}
    # maximum likelihood over nGrid values of pb
    max(lik)             
    # value of pb where likelihood maximized
    pb[lik==max(lik)]    
  }
# estimated maximum likelihood estimator for p_B
Lik.f(nBoys = 30, nGirls = 20, nGrid = 50) 

# more precise MLE for p_B based on finer grid (more points)
Lik.f(nBoys = 30, nGirls = 20, nGrid = 1000)

```

Yeah this is the only piece of visable code in the whole chapter.
